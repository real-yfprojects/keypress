# Linux Typewriter

If you want to make some kind of screencast that features keyboard typing sounds,
this might come in handy. Get the script, run keypress.py and pump up your volume.

## Requirements

* Python
* <code>python-xlib</code> (On Debian-based, install with <code>sudo apt-get install python-xlib)</code>
* aplay command line player, but you really can dump in anything you want, see <code>keypress.py</code>

## What's changed?

Look at the git history and the root project of this fork.

## Can it play different sounds for different keys?

The original one that sayanriju made could, and this one will eventually.
